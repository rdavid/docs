== Overview

A major part of Telco partner certification is
{url-cnf-cert}[CNF Certification Test].
These test cases are specifically designed to verify whether the deployment of
the Telco partner's solution on Red Hat OpenShift follows the
{url-best-cnf}[CNF Best Practices] and the
{url-best-operator}[Operator Best Practices].
By conducting these tests, we ensure that the implementation aligns with the
recommended standards and guidelines for optimal performance and compatibility.

In the suite, there are {url-catalog}[88 test cases], consisting of both
mandatory and optional cases.
These cases are divided among nine different suites.

== Operators

We conducted the {url-cnf-cert}[CNF Certification Test] on over two hundred of
{url-operators}[Red Hat's operators] on OCP {ocp-version}.
Consequently, we have detected an average of approximately thirty failures per
operator.
For additional details, please refer to the
{url-report}[CNF Report for Operators on OCP 4.13].
You can use the operator name filter to narrow down your search.

== Failures

The first priority should be addressing the most commonly required mandatory
tests:

- {url-tainted}[`platform-alteration-tainted-node-kernel`] [1]
- {url-root}[`access-control-security-context-non-root-user-check`]
- {url-termination}[`observability-termination-policy`]
- {url-ubi}[`platform-alteration-isredhat-release`]

[1] A known bug exists in OCP 4.12, specifically within RHCOS 8.6, causing test
failures on one or more master nodes.
Further details can be found in the
{url-tainted-tp}[Tainted Kernel Tech Preview].
There is another {url-tainted-nft}[known bug] present in OCP 4.13.
We should differentiate between taints originating from our side (ideally none)
and those arising from the CNF under test.

The failures are categorized by operators in the
{url-report}[CNF Report for Operators on OCP 4.13].
This method enables the filtering of failures based on specific operators.
