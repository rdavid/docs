== Overview

A major part of Telco partner certification is
{url-cnf-cert}[CNF Certification Test].
These test cases are specifically designed to verify whether the deployment of
the Telco partner's solution on Red Hat OpenShift follows the
{url-best-cnf}[CNF Best Practices] and the
{url-best-operator}[Operator Best Practices].
By conducting these tests, we ensure that the implementation aligns with the
recommended standards and guidelines for optimal performance and compatibility.

In the suite, there are {url-catalog}[88 test cases], consisting of both
mandatory and optional cases.
These cases are divided among nine different suites.

== Operators

We conducted the {url-cnf-cert}[CNF Certification Test] on over two hundred of
{url-operators}[Red Hat's operators] on OCP {ocp-version}.
Consequently, we have detected an average of approximately thirty failures per
operator.
For additional details, please refer to the {url-report}[CNF Report for
Operators - 20231120].
You can use the operator name filter to narrow down your search.

== Failures

The failures are categorized by operators in the {url-report}[CNF Report for
Operators - 20231120].
The report enables the filtering of failures based on specific operators.

The first priority should be addressing the most commonly required mandatory
tests, see the frequencies tab in the report.

== Known Issues

A known bug exists in OCP 4.12, specifically within RHCOS 8.6, causing
{url-tainted}[`platform-alteration-tainted-node-kernel`] failures on one or
more master nodes.
Further details can be found in the {url-tainted-tp}[Tainted Kernel Tech
Preview].
There is another {url-tainted-nft}[known bug] present in OCP 4.13.
We should differentiate between taints originating from our side (ideally none)
and those arising from the CNF under test.
